    The function returns a `ResponseCheck` object containing results from multiple validation checks.
    If any check fails (detects an issue), the ResponseCheck will evaluate to True when used in a boolean context.
    This means code like `if is_bad_response(...)` will enter the if-block when problems are detected.

    For example:
    ```python

        context (str, optional): Optional context/documents used for answering. Required for untrustworthy check.
        query (str, optional): Optional user question. Required for untrustworthy and unhelpful checks.
